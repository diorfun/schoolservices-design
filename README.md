# [TshirtDesigner](https://tshirtdesigner.bykevin.work/)
My client wants to make a website that the users can upload their design on a T-shirt and the website will sell those t-shirts such as [Teespring](https://teespring.com/). So because of that, i decided to build a T-shirt designer that I'll implement on the website.
